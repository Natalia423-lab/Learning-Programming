- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Natalia423-lab
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently learning programming and robotics and I made this github repo so that others can learn as well 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Swift and C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am fluent in both English and French 

# Things I am working on at the moment:

- Python for ai
- Basics of Neural Networks

# Things I plan on doing:

- Swift and Xcode to make applications
- C++
- C++ to design Games
- Godot
- Pygame
- More Neural Networks
- Program with MicroBits
- Use CAD software to make 3D objects

# Things I might do:

- Make a game engine in C++
- Make and train a Neural Network
- Learn C
- Learn Java and JavaScript
- Code my own Linux distro 

 # All of these will take time and I might not even be able to do them all.
